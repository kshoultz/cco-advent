                    <p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first
                        registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. And
                        Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called
                        Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was
                        with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn
                        son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the
                        inn.</p>

                    <h2>IN HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>It happened. The story of Jesus Christ being born wasn't a fairy tale or a myth or a legend. Luke makes sure his
                        readers know that the birth of Jesus took place in our time, in our world. Augustus was Caeser, Quirinius was
                        governor, and Jesus was born into a small town that can still be visited today. In fact, many churches have been
                        built on top of the places where it is believed Jesus may have been born and travelled. This was done because in
                        times of war, churches typically were protected and they could be used to guard sacred sites. Thousands now
                        visit these sites as a way to experience the places Jesus walked. Luke reminds us through these historical
                        details that God came into our story to redeem it. he came to set himself up as the true King. He came to bear
                        all of our sin so that now and forever we could be in the presence of God and the history of Jesus becomes the
                        history of us. How is God currently working in your story?</p>

                                The Advent Wreath is a visible reminder of the coming light of Christ in your home.
                                Each week you light on more candle until Christmas Eve when you light the Christ candle;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The candles are to be lit in this order: November 29 - light the first purple candle;
                                December 20 - add the third purple candle; December 24 - add the white candle
                                in the center.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most families light the candles each night when everyone is at home together and then
                                extinguish the candles before bed. The Advent wreath sits on a table or bookshelf.
                                not hung up on the door like the traditional wreath. Remember that you will actually be
                                lighting the candles so be carefule where you place it! Arrange the purple and pink candles
                                in the four points of a circle like the directions on a compass. The white candle goes in
                                the middle of the circle. Use the greenery to wrap around the candle circle. Feel free to
                                get as decorative and elaborate as you like. This can become a yearly Advent tradition!
