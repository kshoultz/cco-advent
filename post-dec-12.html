                            Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for
                            the
                            consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
                            that he would
                            not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the
                            parents brought
                            in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed
                            God and said,
                            â€œLord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your
                            salvation that
                            you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to
                            your people Israel.

                            The salvation that is seen is that Jesus will make it possible for every person to be in the right
                            relationship with God, and connected to the source of life forever.
