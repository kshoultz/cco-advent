                            Jesus is the Messiah. Matthew attempts to make this point as clearly as possible. It’s why he begins his
                            genealogy
                            of Jesus as the son of David, the son of Abraham, rather than vice versa. It’s why, tracing Jesus’ lineage
                            back to
                            David, he refers to him as the king. It’s why he quotes so much Old Testament scripture that prophesied of
                            the coming
                            Messiah and how Jesus fulfills them. It’s why he wraps up this genealogy noting that between each major unit
                            there were 14 generations.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            This number 14 was a significant number because it was tied to the name of David. In Hebrew there are 22
                            letters
                            in the alphabet, and each letter is given a numerical value. In Hebrew you would spell David’s name using
                            three letters:
                            “Dalet, Vav, Dalet”. Dalet is the fourth letter in the alphabet, and Vav is the sixth. So when you put them
                            together it is: “4 + 6 + 4”
                            and this of course equals 14. Jesus is the Messiah and even history testifies to it.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            Why is this so meaningful? Because the Messiah was supposed to come and put everything right again. He was
                            supposed to
                            bring justice to the nations, and deliverance for Israel. The prophet Isaiah testifies that the Messiah
                            would bring a healing that
                            would include recovery of sight to the blind, the ability to hear for the deaf, and that the lame would walk
                            again. This Messiah will
                            bring an end to all suffering for those who are waiting for him.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            This is the season when we are reminded that he came. He healed the blind, deaf, lame and he took upon
                            himself the burdens of our sin so we could receive complete healing when he comes again. What healing do you
                            desire to receive from this Messiah?
