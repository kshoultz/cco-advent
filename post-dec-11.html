                            When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief
                            priests and scribes of the people,
                            he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is
                            written by the prophet: “‘And you, O
                            Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a

                            Sheep are mentioned in the Bible more than any other animal. They were used for all kinds of things:
                            clothes, dinner, religion –
                            there is a lot you can do with a sheep. They often travelled in herds and were tended to by a shepherd. He
                            would make sure to
                            lead them to places to graze and eat, but also protect them from predators. Because sheep were used for so
                            much they were a
                            prized possession and often the shepherd would know how many were in his care. This was especially true for
                            when a sheep wandered off and the shepherd must seek it out.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            Sheep also became great metaphors for the people of God, and it was often said that all of us were sheep
                            without a shepherd.
                            This means that we wandered for a food source and were without protection. It means we didn’t have any sort
                            of care or guidance
                            so that our grazing was without true aim. It means that we were becoming separated from the herd. But
                            Matthew makes it clear through
                            citing Micah 5:2 that one of Jesus’ primary roles was to be the Shepherd of his people.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            Psalm 23 expresses the idea of what the Shepherd would do. He would lead us to green pastures and still
                            waters to rest
                            and restore us. He would use his strength to defend us from the enemies’. He would gather us together so
                            that we could
                            enjoy a life of fellowship not only with each other, but with him. Jesus is the Shepherd we need. He is the
                            Shepherd willing
                            to lay down his life. Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we no longer fear evil.
                            Let Jesus guide your life.
