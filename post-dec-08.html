                            The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world
                            was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive
                            him.
                            But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who
                            were born,
                            not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

                            Children are inheritors. More than that, they are often the reflection of the parents.
                            They tend to model both the best and worst parts of their personality. Part of the goal of raising
                            children within the first century was not only to create additional labor for the work of the Patriarch,
                            but so that they could inherit all that there was when the Patriarch passed away and continue the name.

                            The point John is making is that we have no parents. We work but only for things that will perish.
                            We inherit, but only that which will fade away. The only personality we model is that which has been
                            distorted by sin. We are cosmic orphans living on a borrowed world. But Jesus came so that in believing, we
                            may be adopted.

                            In our belief we are accepted into the family of God. The worst parts of us are exposed before
                            an incredible light, but it graciously shows us the path to follow. We carry out the work and will
                            of God and in the death of Jesus we inherit all the blessings we never deserved. In Jesus, every
                            part of the family that sin distorted, God redeems.

                                In a large bowl or stand mixer, add 3/4 cup butter flavored Crisco and 1 cup brown sugar. Beat well until smooth,
                                about 1 or 2 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add 1 egg and 1/4 cup molasses. Beat well, scraping sides, until fully incorporated.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add 2 and 1/4 cups flour, but don't stir yet. Make sure you spoon the flour into the measuring cup so that it doesn't
                                get packed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On top of the flour, add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and ginger, and 1/2
                                teaspoon cloves. Use a small spoon to stir all the dry ingredients into the flour.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Beat well until just barely combined. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and make sure that all the flour is
                                incorporated, but do not over mix. (or you will get tough cookies.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cover the bowl and chill in the fridge for about 2-3 hours, until it is completely cold. Do not skip this step or you
                                will get flat cookies!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add about a 1/2 cup sugar to a small bowl.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Shape the dough into walnut-sized balls, about 1 and 1/2 inches across. Roll the dough in the sugar to coat
                                completely, then place on a lined baking sheet with about 2 inches of space between each one.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Bake at 350 for 8-9 minutes, just until the tops start to crack. As soon as you see cracks, take them out! Keep an
                                eye on them, because every oven is different. If you let them bake too long, they will fall flat after you take them out
                                of the oven.
                            </li>

                                Sprinkle with additional granulated sugar if you want, for extra sparkle.

                            <li>
                                Let cool on the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. You have to eat at least one of these
                                while they are warm, it's mandatory.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Bake them exactly as the recipe states. Do NOT over bake! You need these cookies to be nice and soft so that when you
                                bite into them with the frosting in between, they do not crunch. The should be super soft, even on the edges. You should
                                get about 30 cookies. Let cool completely on a wire rack.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In a large bowl or stand mixer, use the whisk attachment (if you have one) to beat the softened butter until it is
                                fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add half of the powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons cream or milk. Beat well. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add the remaining powdered sugar and 2 more tablespoons of cream or milk. Beat well.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add salt and vanilla extract. Beat well. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add remaining 1-2 tablespoons of cream, if needed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Generously frost the flat side of one ginger molasses cookie. Smash the flat side of another ginger molasses cookie
                                on top.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                IF you can stand to wait, let the cookie sandwiches sit in a covered tupperware for about an hour before serving. You
                                can even make them a day ahead of time. As the frosting sits with the cookie, it softens the cookies even more!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Store in a tupperware on the counter for 2-3 days. Honestly mine have never lasted that long.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These cookies freeze very well! I can't promise that the presentation after freezing would be nice enough for
                                gifting, but you could certainly eat them yourself. Freeze for up to 2 weeks, then let thaw on the counter in a sealed
                                container.
