                            The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world
                            was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive
                            him.
                            But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who
                            were born,
                            not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

                            Children are inheritors. More than that, they are often the reflection of the parents.
                            They tend to model both the best and worst parts of their personality. Part of the goal of raising
                            children within the first century was not only to create additional labor for the work of the Patriarch,
                            but so that they could inherit all that there was when the Patriarch passed away and continue the name.

                            The point John is making is that we have no parents. We work but only for things that will perish.
                            We inherit, but only that which will fade away. The only personality we model is that which has been
                            distorted by sin. We are cosmic orphans living on a borrowed world. But Jesus came so that in believing, we
                            may be adopted.

                            In our belief we are accepted into the family of God. The worst parts of us are exposed before
                            an incredible light, but it graciously shows us the path to follow. We carry out the work and will
                            of God and in the death of Jesus we inherit all the blessings we never deserved. In Jesus, every
                            part of the family that sin distorted, God redeems.
