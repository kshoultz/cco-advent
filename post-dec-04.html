                            And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all
                            the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is
                            Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying
                            in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
                            heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with
                            whom he is pleased!” When the angels went away from them into heaven,
                            the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which
                            the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste and found
                            Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.

                            No short cuts or privilege. That’s how our God entered the world. The angel came to declare the Gospel, the
                            good news, that the savior,
                            heir of David, Messiah, and Lord was born, and the sign was that they would find him swaddled and lying in a
                            feeding trough.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            They came to Bethlehem because there was a decree for all Jews to be registered, and since Joseph was from
                            the line of David they
                            had to leave Nazareth and go to Bethlehem. This was the infamous city that was prophesied as the birth place
                            of the Messiah.
                            It’s interesting that they sought to stay in an inn, because if this was where Joseph was registering you
                            would think he would have family
                            that would allow them to stay. Perhaps his family had disowned him at this point because of his marriage to
                            Mary in spite of her getting pregnant beforehand.
                            Nonetheless, there was no room in the inn and so they perhaps stayed in a sort of barn.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            Mary went into labor and when the baby was born they laid him in a manger. The circumstances for the life of
                            Jesus are reminders that when he came he identified with the lowest of low. He was born into nothing and he
                            would
                            ultimately die a criminal’s death so that he could relate with every single person on the earth. No matter
                            who you are,
                            no matter your circumstance, God understands from personal experience the depth of human suffering, and he
                            will
                            take it completely upon himself so as to redeem it. What can you give over to God to redeem this season?
