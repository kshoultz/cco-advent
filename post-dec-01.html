                            Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba, and Mary. All of these women were mentioned in the
                            genealogy of Jesus. Very rarely will a woman ever be mentioned in a genealogy, but to
                            mention these women is especially curious. Tamar dressed like a prostitute to trick her
                            Father-in-law into sleeping with her, Rahab was a prostitute that sold out her own country
                            so that the Israelites could capture it, Ruth was a Moabite who ended up becoming a
                            servant to her Mother-in-Law until Boaz mercifully took her as his wife, and Bathsheba
                            committed adultery with David while her husband was off to war.

                            These are scandalous stories, but they give rise to this final scandal where Mary would
                            tell people of her miraculous conception. She would have to tell her husband that an
                            angel told her she would give birth to a Jewish King in the line of David. She would have
                            to endure the social ostracization that would come from people assuming her immorality.
                            Why would God choose to do it this way? Why would God choose to use these scandalous
                            stories to bring about his purposes?

                            To remind us, who inherit the story, that it isn't about what we did or didn't achieve, but
                            about what God can achieve in us. We are reminded through the genealogy of Christ that
                            God works through the undeserving and broken people to accomplish his incredible purposes,
                            and he desires to work through you. How has God worked through you lately?

                            Advent is a season of anticipation. Our focal prayer this year is <span class="emphasized">KINGDOM,
                                COME</span>, which
                            centers around the anticipation of celebrating the birth of King Jesus, as well as longing for
                            his return to establish his Kingdom in fullness. At the time of his birth, Jesus was not
                            welcomed as a King would be, yet his arrival ushered in a new era of God's Kingdom. This
                            event would set in motion the fulfillment of every promise, the reconciliation of humanity with
                            our God, the restoration of everything that had been broken, and the beginning of a Kingdom
                            that can never be shaken, one filled with hope, peace, joy, and love.
                        </p>

                            This unshakable, eternal Kingdom, inspired us to use the imagery of a castle - a fortress that
                            not only declares royalty and often inspires reverence, but one that also exudes power and
                            promises refuge. It is a reminder that the Kingdom established at Christ's birth is one that
                            lasts. It is strong enough to weather this season of in-between - the now, while still not yet,
                            where Christ is reigning, yet earth still groans for the King to return and make all things new.

                                The color palette we chose knits together this Kingdom them with
                                traditional Advent colors. The gold communicates royalty, excitement, and
                                immense value while also nodding to the imagery John uses in Revelation
                                to describe the Kingdom of God at Christ's return. The muted pink is a
                                variation of the traditional Advent color of pink or rose, used in the third
                                week (and the third candle in the Advent wreath) to represent joy. The
                                deep purple holds the strongest ties to Advent tradition and symbolizes
                                preparation, repentance, and royalty in expectation of the coming King.
                                You may also recognize that the first, second, and fourth candles of the
                                Advent wreath are traditionally purple as well.

                            Candles are another key element of the Advent celebration, signifying the birth of Christ as
                            the light entering a dark world. Candles play a central role in our weekly gatherings and can
                            be and instructive and rich tradition within your home in creating your own Advent wreath. We
                            wanted to supplement the overall design theme with candles which you will find scattered
                            throughout the pages in an effort to tie all of our experiences together. Whether you gather
                            with us on Sunday evenings or you watch online and participate with those in your home
                            using this website as a guide, we light these candles together and we pray together as heirs
                            of King Jesus, Kingdom, Come.
