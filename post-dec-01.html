                    <p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>

                    <h2>IN HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>It happened. The story of Jesus Christ being born wasn't a fairy tale or a myth or a legend. Luke makes sure his readers know that the birth of Jesus took place in our time, in our world. Augustus was Caeser, Quirinius was governor, and Jesus was born into a small town that can still be visited today. In fact, many churches have been built on top of the places where it is believed Jesus may have been born and travelled. This was done because in times of war, churches typically were protected and they could be used to guard sacred sites. Thousands now visit these sites as a way to experience the places Jesus walked. Luke reminds us through these historical details that God came into our story to redeem it. he came to set himself up as the true King. He came to bear all of our sin so that now and forever we could be in the presence of God and the history of Jesus becomes the history of us. How is God currently working in your story?</p>

                    <p>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has annointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion - to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that the may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.</p>
