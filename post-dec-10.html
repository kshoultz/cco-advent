                            1:20b-23</h3>
                        <p class="italicized">
                            Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take
                            Mary as your wife,
                            for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name
                            Jesus, for he will save
                            his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
                            “Behold, the virgin shall conceive
                            and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, God with us).

                            Trust. It is what all relationships are built from. At any point a promise is made it must be followed up
                            with action.
                            It must be followed up by completion. If not, the integrity of the relationship is at stake; All
                            vulnerability and transparency would become insecurity and fear.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            When the Old Testament was finished it would be 400 years until God would speak again through Jesus and the
                            New Testament writers.
                            400 years Israel waited for God’s promises to come true; For God to act and complete all that he said.
                            Insecurity and fear developed
                            as people wondered if God had forgotten them. They wondered if they were abandoned to live under the cruelty
                            of Roman authority forever.
                            But they kept up their traditions and retold the stories of old that demonstrated the faithfulness of God.
                            When Jesus finally came, he became
                            the fulfillment of everything God ever said. Trust was restored and the relationship between Israel and God
                            would be forever changed.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: #4a3b47 !important;">
                            This is often how we approach God. We wonder if life will get better or if he really is active in our lives.
                            We wonder how long we must wait
                            for him to come and finish what he started. But the entrance of Jesus into the world means that all things
                            are coming to a close.
                            All sin and evil are dealt with as God patiently waits for the full number of his people to come to faith.
                            God’s faithfulness often feels long because
                            he is slowly redeeming the faithlessness of his people.
