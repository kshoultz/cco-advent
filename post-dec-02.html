                            Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they
                            came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and
                            unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.
                        </p>

                    <h1 style="color: #cb8840 !important;">HOW JESUS CAME: through the Spirit</h1>
                    <div class="cco-content">
                        <p>
                            It was a miraculous event. By a miracle we mean something that violates or interrupts natural physical laws. No
                            scientist could observe or explain this. Mary was pregnant and it was through the power of the Holy Spirit.
                        </p><p>
                            The Holy Spirit’s power is seen throughout scripture. It was in the beginning when all things came into existence. It
                            helped heroes of the faith overcome huge obstacles and more importantly, its achievements were dramatic events that
                            pointed back to God. When the Spirit moved, everyone knew it was the God of Israel.
                        </p><p>
                            Now we come to this moment in time where God would interrupt once again. He would fulfill the prophecies made so long
                            ago and all the promises would finally be answered, “yes”. In one of the greatest mysteries of all time, God would be
                            Immanuel, “with us”.
                        </p><p>
                            Now we are reminded that through faith, every day is a day with access to this power; It will help us overcome
                            obstacles, but also give us rest in the midst of them; It will produce for us every bit of goodness we failed to produce
                            on our own; And it has sealed us for an everlasting glory that we begin to enjoy now until it comes again in the return
                            of our Christ King. The Spirit’s power in our life will be a constant dramatic event that points back to the power,
                            promises and presence of God. Ask God to use this power for his glory this season.
