                            Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, 
                            behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he who has
                            been born king of the Jews? For we saw his start when it rose and have come to 
                            worship him." When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
                            with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he 
                            inquired of them where Christ was to be born.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="cco-default">
                        <h1 style="color: #cb8840 !important;">Under Threat</h1>
                        <div class="cco-content">
                            <p>
                                Herod feared for his throne. He was the king and would not allow another to take that 
                                away from him. The status that he held and the luxury it provided were things he was not 
                                willing to give up for any man, even if he was God.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We see this clearly when Herod learns from three non-Jewish wise men that they had 
                                heard a king of the Jews was to be born. How could they have known? Who would have 
                                told these Gentiles about a new king of the Jews, and whyu would they travel to see him?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's because they knew this was no ordinary king. Jesus was a man that deserved to be 
                                worshipped. They were ready to give up every part of their culture and adopt whatever 
                                ideas this new king brought with him. They were ready to forfeit everything that once 
                                characterized their lives and replace it with Jesus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                God calls us to do the same. We all feel the threat when Jesus makes demands on our lives. 
                                We all feel defensive when this new king confronts our selfish souls. So let this season be 
                                one where we lay down everything and worship him. May we seek the Savior for his glory 
                                instead of to protect our own. May we love him and others more than we love ourselves.
                            </p>
